# cora-eclipse
Cora-eclipse is a project to enable easy setup of an Eclipse install for Cora development, using Eclipse and Docker.</br>
I am running this on linux so, change as needed for other platforms.

## Before you begin
1. Make sure you have git and docker set up on your local machine
2. Make a directory where you want everything installed /x/y/z/cora (/mnt/depot/cora)
3. `cd /x/y/z/cora` to your new directory
4. Clone this repository: `git clone https://github.com/olovm/cora-eclipse.git`
5. (if problem with poping subwindows run "xhost +" on the host machine

if you need a different version of the dev environment than master, look under the heading:<br>
Starting dev environement cora-eclipse with different version than master

## Installing, runAll
The runAll script will take you through the entire process of setting up a docker based development environment for Cora. It will go through all needed steps. </br>
You can get your docker group id by running:
`getent group docker`

Run:</br>
`./cora-eclipse/runAll.sh dockerGroupId`</br>
**or run:**</br>
`./cora-eclipse/runAll.sh dockerGroupId master nocache`</br>
This option will do a pull of the base image, and not use the cache so that you get the latest version of the packages that gets installed from Fedora.

This scrip will, run the following headers automatically

### Build docker image
(Automatically run by runAll)<br>
This will take some time as it downloads quite a few things, eclipse, tomcat, etc

### Create directories on host 
(Automatically run by runAll)<br>
1. workspace (for your eclipse workspace)
2. eclipse (for your eclipse installation)
3. eclipseP2 (for files shared between multiple installations of eclipse)
4. m2 (for maven files)

### Docker first run installing eclipse
(Automatically run by runAll)<br>
When the container starts for the first time will it run the installation part of entrypoint.sh. This will
clone all Cora repositories, add other remotes to all of them, install needed npm karma in cora-jsclient and
start the eclipse installer (oomph). </br>

#### Cloning projects for Cora
You need to choose the remote you want to use as origin for cloning the Cora projects<br>
If you are uncertain use option **1. https://github.com/lsu-ub-uu/**

#### Eclipse installation
There are a few things that needs to be choosen in the installer<br>
First of all switch to **advanced mode** in the installer
 1. Browse for setup files for eclipse, **/home/yourUserName/workspace/cora-eclipse/oomph/EclipseForCora.setup** (use the plussign to add)
 2. Product version, set it to: **2025-03 Eclipse environment for Cora**
 3. Java 23+ VM, set it to: /usr/lib/jvm/**java-23-openjdk**
 
next step
 
 1. In next step browse for setup for projects, **/home/yourUserName/workspace/cora-eclipse/oomph/CoraProjects.setup** (use the plussign to add)
 2. Make sure **Cora projects** are marked

next step
 
 1. Choose installation location: **Installed in the specified absolute folder location**
 2. Fill in path for "Root install folder": set it to **/home/yourUserName/eclipse**
 3. Fill in path for "Installation location": set it to **/home/yourUserName/eclipse**
 4. Choose Workspace location rule: **Located in the absolute folder location**
 5. Fill in path for "Workspace location": **/home/yourUserName/workspace**
 6. Fill in path for "JRE 23 Location": **/usr/lib/jvm/java-23-openjdk**
 
next step<br>

finish
 
Saros might not allow you to log in, if so, skipp that step and do it later
<br>
This should get you through the installer and will eventually start eclipse and do a first run to setup eclipse. 
You can click on the spinning arrows, in the bottom of the screen to see what the setup does.
<br>
**Wait** for the setuptasks to finnish, no more spinning arrows, close eclipse, and then close the installer window. 
<br>
You are now ready to do a first startup of the environment. 

## if docker explorer do not show dockers
update the docker plugin through the marketplace<br>
(search for docker)


## Finishing up, your first startup of the environment
Start the environment by running:</br>
`./eclipse202503forcora2/startEclipseForCora.sh`
<br>
 **Do the following in the listed order to avoid problems!**
 1. Go in under preferences and make sure the latest java is choosen as default jre
 2. In project explorer, under the three little dots, deselect working sets
 3. Mark all projects and refresh them, menu or F5 (this will make sure eclipse sees files in target folders)
 4. Go under External Tools Configurations (play icon with toolbox), run mvnPomCleanInstallAllButDocker
 5. Go under External Tools Configurations (play icon with toolbox), run mvnPomCleanInstallDevDocker
 6. Rightclick any project, and choose, maven / update project... (or F5) select all projects and run

### Start systemOne
1. Go under External Tools Configurations (play icon with toolbox) and start the docker containers for development by running **systemoneStartDevDockers**
2. Start fitnesse, Go under Run Configurations (play icon) and start **systemOne-fitnesse**
3. Find the server tab and **start the tomcat servers for systemOne**
4. Go under External Tools Configurations (play icon with toolbox) and run **indexSystemOneMetadata**
3. See links section below to find the running system

(or similar to run Alvin or DiVA)

### Debugging FitNesse
Add the following to the top of the page, then use remoteDebugging such as DivaFitnesseDebug to connect to it when testing.
```
!path {java.class.path}
!define COMMAND_PATTERN {/usr/lib/jvm/java-23-openjdk/bin/java -Xdebug -Xrunjdwp:transport=dt_socket,server=y,suspend=y,address=8000 -cp %p %m}
```

### For adding marketplace to oomph installer (note to self)
https://stackoverflow.com/questions/47582157/eclipse-marketplace-plug-ins-silent-install
Given a Marketplace install URL (https://marketplace.eclipse.org/marketplace-client-intro?mpc_install={ID}), construct the API URL as https://marketplace.eclipse.org/node/{ID}/api/p. Retrieve the XML file from that URL and look for the repository URL in the updateURL tag, and the available features in the ius tag. You'll need to append .feature.group to each IU feature listed

### Adding cert information for connection to Fedora Commons
For alvin server go into the launch configuration / arguments under VM arguments  add<br>
-Djavax.net.ssl.trustStore="/home/olov/workspace/cora-docker-fedora/files/fedoraKeystore.jks" -Djavax.net.ssl.trustStorePassword="changeit"

### exporting data from connected databases
connect to shell in devEnvironment:

`docker exec -it eclipse202503forcora2 bash `

to export data from running DiVA db run:
`pg_dump -U diva -h diva-cora-docker-postgresql -p 5432 -t organisation diva > ~/workspace/diva-cora-docker-postgresql/docker/data/exported.sql`


### Archive problem 
If problems with archive test for path not found:
enter docker:

`docker exec -it eclipse202503forcora2 bash`

go to your home dir:

`cd /home/yourUserName`

create needed dir in temp:

`mkdir /tmp/sharedArchiveReadable`

run archive readable:

`./archiveReadable.sh`
